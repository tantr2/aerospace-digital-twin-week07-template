## Supplied setup (instructor supplied)

### question — instructor supplied
Calculate required control moment, elevator moment, and the change with airspeed. Explain whether the nominal response meets +0.12 rad/s².

### system — instructor supplied
Illustrative planar pitch model. Aircraft geometry, integration, force conversion and constraints are supplied.

### representation — instructor supplied
Body axes forward/right/down. Positive pitch moment nose-up. Positive Fz downward. Positive elevator trailing edge down. Reference/CG X=0 m; tail X=-3 m.

### inputs — instructor supplied
Iy=5000 kg·m²; target=+0.12 rad/s²; competing=-750 N-m; density=1.225 kg/m³; V=40 m/s; S=16 m²; chord=1.5 m; Cmδ=-0.8/rad; elevator=-5°. Inputs are illustrative, not calibrated.

## Student responses

### physics
**Prompt:** Explain why a downward force aft of the CG gives a positive nose-up moment.

**Student response:**
```
A downward force behind the CG pushes the tail down, causing the nose to rotate upward. Since the sign convention defines nose up moment as positive, this produces a positive pitch moment.
```

### assumptions
**Prompt:** Explain one supplied assumption and what could invalidate it: planar motion, fixed reference, local linear effectiveness, no trim or damping.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### model
**Prompt:** Write your demand, dynamic-pressure, coefficient and moment equations. Identify which quantities are supplied and which are unknown.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### prediction
**Prompt:** Before running your own implementation, predict the sign of its elevator moment and the effect of halving airspeed. Explain the competing moment.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### verification
**Prompt:** Show one independent hand calculation with units. Compare it with your model, and explain a sign, unit, or limiting-case check.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### claim
**Prompt:** What do your computed results support at the stated condition? Include a limitation.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### reflection
**Prompt:** What additional evidence or missing physics would you investigate next?

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._

### AI use
**Prompt:** Identify the AI tool and how you used it, what you changed, and how you independently checked the result. State “No AI used” if applicable.

**Student response:**
_Missing — no response supplied._
